My Resume
Presently I am an MBA participant at Symbiosis Centre for Management and Human Resources Developement (SCMHRD) looking for a successful management career in the field of Marketing and Advertising . 
Sales Management , ATL - BTL Marketing initiatives , Strategic Brand Management, Brand Activation, Competitive Analysis, Consumer Research & Forecasting are few of the areas I would like to have more exposure on and to hone my analytical skills further.

the blend strong technical and Analytical skills while making use of my understanding of Marketing . 

Thinking out of the box keeps me awake at night . I can assure you that you will not be disappointed by me. I have a trick or two up my sleeve for almost everything.
